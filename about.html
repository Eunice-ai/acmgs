        <p class="main-paragraph">
          The Anglican missions established ACMGS Elelenwo in the year 1943. The
          school was named after Archdeacon Dandison Crowther to immortalize the
          memory of his immeasurable contributions and interest in the education
          of the girl child. The initial enrolment at the time of establishment
          was fifty-one girls from Anglican origin. Entrance examination and
          interviews were conducted and eligible candidates were offered
          admission into what was then called form one, two and three. By the
          subsequent years the forms increased to four and five. The school has
          since then registered and passed out many students. This premier
          institution was run as a Mission School till the break of the
          Nigeria-Biafra civil war in 1967. Over the years, the School was known
          to have raised an appreciable number of “Old Girls” who rose to
          position of relevance in both Government and the Private Sectors.
          After the civil war in 1970, Government decided to take over the
          Mission Schools and began to run them as Government/Public Schools.
          But the law on Government Hand-over of Mission Schools to their
          original owners passed in our State – Rivers, on 30th July, 2005 and
          implemented 25th July, 2008 brought about the return of this great
          institution, together with nineteen(19) others to different
          denominations that established them. This development has, no doubt,
          afforded the Lord Bishop of the Diocese of Evo, Rt. Rev. Innocent U.
          Ordu, JP the golden opportunity to actualize his passion which is to
          see this School rise again. VISION
